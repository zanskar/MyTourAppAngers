# MyTourAppAngers

## Description
This is the fifth project of the second phase of Google Developer Challenge Scholarship - Android Basics - 2017/2018, on order to obtain a nanodegree. The subject was to create a Tour Guide app, with multiple screens containing at least 4 lists of relevant attractions for a given city. Moving between screens is made by using a ViewPager plus TabLayout (or a Navigation Drawer) combined with Fragments.
Each list is filled with list items, populated using a custom adapter.

I chose to make an app about the city of Angers, main city in the region where I live in France. TabLayout gives access to monuments, restaurants, sports and parks information.

## Technical points

  <li>Use of ViewPagerplus TabLayout</li>

</ul>
